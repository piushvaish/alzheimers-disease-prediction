# Classification of Alzheimers Disease Stages using Radiology Imaging and Longitudinal Clinical Data

Alzheimer's disease is an irreparable, degenerative disease with ongoing loss of
functions of the brain. Currently, there is no medicine or treatment present to stop
or slow down the progression. 

The identification of different stages for diagnosis
require a combination of clinical data, complex cognitive tests, radiology imaging,
demographic information, time and highly skilled physicians. Recent machine
learning techniques can help to provide a process to extract insights and improve
the quality of life for the patients and assist the physicians. 

In this project, various
machine learning techniques such as feature selection, feature engineering, dealing
with imbalanced data, imputation of missing values and standardization are applied.
Multiple algorithms are also compared before performing random grid search to
tune hyperparameters for classifiers and developing an ensemble learner to classify
three clinical stages (normal, mild cognitive impairment and dementia). 

Cognitive
tests, magnetic resonance imaging of left hippocampus and cortical thickness of
right entorhinal are discovered to be important features for prediction. 

This finding
is similar to that reported in a number of studies. The model can equally distinguish
between a class and other classes with an average area under the receiver operating
characteristics score of 0.83. 

This is within the range of the evaluation metric of
existing state-of-the-art models. 

A web-based application is developed and deployed
to the cloud to address the gap for the user to benefit from the developed model.
This result in an end-to-end pipeline that will empower the user with a practical
application and contribute to the active research in the area.
